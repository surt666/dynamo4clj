# dynamo4clj

Clojure API for Amazon DynamoDB

## Usage

### with config files
Put a file called aws.properties in src (or somewhere else where it ends up in the root of the classpath) with your aws keys in the format:

accessKey:blabla
secretKey:fooooo

Optionally put a config.properties file in src with the following optional parameters

proxy-host=sltarray
proxy-port=8080
region=dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

    (def client (get-client))


### with config map 

(def client (dyn/get-client {:access-key "foo" :secret-key "bar" :proxy-host "example.com" :proxy-port 8080 :region "dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"}))

### api-calls 

    (get-item client "seq" "events_seq")

    (get-batch-items client [["products" [1101001 1101101]] ["prices" [["ys" 1101001] ["kab" 1101201]]]])

    (delete-item client "seq" "events_seq")

    (update-item client "seq" "login_count" {:value [1 "add"]})

    (scan client "events")

    (scan client  "events" [["author" "eq" "steen"]])

    (find-items client "events" "NORMAL" true)   

    (find-items client "events" "NORMAL" true ["between" 715 815])
